## Mixed Tableau Visualizations - Predictive Modeling:

Created visualizations from my Predictive Modeling class in Tableau, while also using R and Excel to clean data. I’m currently locked out of my Tableau account and can’t access Tableau Workbook files, these are visualizations I had screenshots of, which I posted on Github, my Tableau Public is still active → public.tableau.com/app/mab1096
